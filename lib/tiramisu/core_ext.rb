module Kernel

  # when called with a no-nil no-false argument it defines, register and returns a spec.
  # when called with a nil or false argument it defines and returns a spec but does not register it.
  # when called without arguments it defines a global setup that will run on each new created spec/context.
  #
  # @note a Unit Module is a regular Ruby Module that when included will execute the Unit's block on base
  #
  # @example define regular specs
  #   spec :some_spec do
  #     # ...
  #   end
  #
  # @example define a spec that will run on its own and can also be included into another specs/contexts
  #   shared = spec :some_shared_spec do
  #     # ...
  #   end
  #   # `shared` is now a spec good for inclusion in another specs/contexts.
  #
  # @example define a spec that wont run on itself but can be included into another specs/contexts
  #   Shared = spec nil do
  #     # ...
  #   end
  #   # `Shared` is now a module good for inclusion in another specs/contexts
  #   # but because `nil` used as first argument it wont run as a spec itself
  #
  # @example define a global setup, i.e. a block that will run inside any new defined spec/context
  #   spec do
  #     include Rack::Test # now Rack::Test will be included in any spec/context
  #   end
  #
  def spec label = (noargs=true; nil), &block
    block || raise(ArgumentError, 'missing block')

    if noargs
      # no arguments given, defining a global setup and returning
      return Tiramisu::GLOBAL_SETUPS << block
    end

    if label
      # a no-nil no-false argument given, defining a regular spec
      Tiramisu.define_and_register_a_spec(label, block)
    end

    # defining a shared spec that wont run itself
    # but can be included in another specs/contexts
    Tiramisu.define_unit_module(block)
  end

  # when used out of tests it defines a assertion helper.
  # the block should return a no-false no-nil value for assertion to pass.
  # the block will receive tested object as first argument
  # and any arguments passed to assertion as consequent ones.
  # it will also receive the passed block.
  #
  # @example checks whether two arrays has same keys, orderlessly
  #   assert :has_same_keys_as do |a, b|
  #     a.keys.sort == b.keys.sort
  #   end
  #
  #   spec :some_spec do
  #     test :some_test do
  #       a = [1, 2]
  #       b = [2, 1]
  #       assert(a).has_same_keys_as(b) # => true
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example same assertion by multiple names
  #   assert :includes, :to_include do |a, b|
  #     a.keys.sort == b.keys.sort
  #   end
  #
  #   spec :some_spec do
  #     test :some_test do
  #       a = [1, 2]
  #       assert(a).includes(1) # => true
  #       # same
  #       expect(a).to_include(1) # => true
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @param [Array] *labels
  #
  def assert *labels, &block
    labels.any? || raise(ArgumentError, 'Wrong number of arguments, 0 for 1+')
    block || raise(ArgumentError, 'missing block')
    labels.each {|label| Tiramisu.assertions[label.to_sym] = block}
  end

  # stop executing any code and report a failure
  #
  # @example
  #   x > y || fail('x should be greater than y')
  #
  # @param reason
  #
  def fail *reason
    reason.empty? && raise(ArgumentError, 'Wrong number or arguments, 0 for 1+')
